Newer to Chicago, just recently hit my 6 year with my wonderful girlfriend and I’d like to do something nice. I’ll tell you a little about us and maybe you guys can help? 

We’re looking to go out on Friday maybe around 4. We are pretty far Northside near kimball brown line. We are looking to try ramen for the first time in the city and then we were thinking of taking a walk or maybe going to a cool bar like emporium or something. We aren’t huge on crowds so we would probably go before it got busy. We just wanna try some fruity drinks and enjoy the day.

We have a kid and my aunt won’t be staying to late so we would prefer something a shorter distance away from us as we’re not driving so uber or public transit.. we also are not looking to spend to much if possible.

I do apologize for asking for help it’s just I feel like whenever I take the time plan things I always mess it up somehow and I also don’t know much about this city yet  ",,

By exploring around the city, I mean would you be likely to go to explore new neighborhoods all over the city for fun. There's 77 of them so lots to explore. Or do you usually just stay in the neighborhood you live in and a few neighborhoods that you frequent.

So for example, if you live in Roscoe Village and you mainly just go into the rest of Lakeview, Downtown, Lincoln Park, and maybe like occasionally Lincoln Sqaure, but never really go to other places that'd be the latter.

If you explore all around and go to like South Shore, up to Rogers Park, Uptown, Wicker Park, Downtown, Chinatown, Ukrainian Village, etc., that'd be the former.

Personally I'm more of the explorer type, myself. If I stay in my same area I get extremely restless. Also my area is just not *as* diverse as some other areas near me, so I oftentimes (like any day I'm free) try to get out to other areas. I like (or more accurately, feel drawn to) the diversity in Rogers Park, Uptown, Albany, West Ridge etc. I also like the vibes of Wicker Park, Chinatown, Hyde Park etc. I also like getting out to the suburbs, and find that Glenview, Morton Grove and Niles have some great diversity and food.",,

* We had an AirBnB in Bucktown and it was a great spot for us. Right on a bus stop. Quick access to the Blue and Brown trains.
* We ordered grocery delivery the first day so we could eat breakfasts in the condo and one dinner. That was easy, affordable and quick!
* The 7-day CTA pass was just fantastic. Got us everywhere we wanted to go efficiently, easily and remarkably cheaply. We only Uber-d a couple of times. Only downside: the incessant smell of dope in the trains. People just can't help being selfish a-holes. It's the human condition.
* All meals were good, most were great. Prices feel high but that's modern life. Service was uniformly professional and solid. In fact: I think we've become so numb to shitty service in restaurants that Chicago was a revelation. We had great service in almost every spot.
   * Kyuramen - Is this a tourist spot? Because it sure as hell was good. Fantastic lunch.
   * Kai Zan sushi - Amazing and beautiful food.
   * Little Bad Wolf - We split a burger and a grilled romaine salad. Large portions. We almost got in a fight over sharing the burger. SOOOOOOO good.
   * Serio Pizza - The crust was a perfect balance point between Neapolitan airiness and char and New York structure and chew. Tomato sauce was bright and fresh. Grande mozzarella. It's not cheap but it's a GREAT pie. Stand out service.
   * Ed and Jean's Tavern - We only had a couple of cocktails, but they were GREAT, and the spot was a highlight of the trip. We wanted to go twice but ran out of time.
   * Pompette - We went for breakfast and the coffee was strong and the shakshuka was perfect.
   * Publican - what a great place. We had a disappointing server (she was very nice but was simply overmatched once it got busy). We had prix fixe Sunday special meal that was delicious and memorable.
   * King of Chicken - Quick lunch salads. The chicken was moist and flavorful. House made salsas were delicious!
   * Mr. Beef - We didn't realize that this was the spot that was used as inspiration for The Bear (which we love). The sandwich was GREAT but feeling like part of a tourist mob made us feel dorky. Surprisingly friendly counter help considering the pressure from the crowd. The fries were meh. But that means we ate less of them.
   * The Hat - Quick lunch. Unmemorable diner.
* We saw ""School for Scandal"" at The Edge theater. LOVED IT. Almost claustrophobic the space is so tight, but the actors were great.
* The boat tour done by the Architecture Center was expensive but well worth it. The 90 minutes FLEW by and there was so much information I wish it would have been a 2.5-hour tour. I thought I knew a LOT about buildings, history and design in Chicago. I learned I have a LOT to learn. They give you access to the Center itself with a ticket stub and $5. That was a good use of time too. The model of the city on the main floor almost made me faint. It is amazing.
* The museum of design is free and interesting.
* Millenium Park and the Cloud / ""bean"" was interesting in that there was some turd walking around telling folks he'd take their pictures (with their phones). Once he handed the phone back to them, he'd ask them for a money for the trouble. High pressure sales especially on young females. I walked behind him and told folks I'd do it for free. He got agro and called me a motherfucker. ME? Sir, I'm offended.
* Highly recommend watching ""The Untouchables"" before you go to Chicago so you can go see all the cool filming locations. It's criminal that they tore down Malone's apartment on Racine.
* We handed our transit passes back to the CTA employees at MDW since they had 2 days left on them. They said they will give them to people in a pinch.
* My wife is mad we didn't do the observation deck / tilt thing at Hancock tower. It's ridiculously expensive. I've been up in the Willis / Sears Tower. It was cool but if you've been in a plane, you've seen the view.

So, thank you, windy city for a wonderful time. It was good to see you all again. Can't wait to come back!

So please bare with me.

So my partner (23NB) and I (22NB) semi-recently moved to Illinois (live further south of Chicago though), but a few of my friends want to meet and hang in Chicago this weekend (3/28-3/30). The ideas we have for the weekend are as follows:

- Going to (preferably) a gay bar
- Going to Chinatown to look around/shop/eat.

From my brief research I saw Boystown/Northalsted was good for gay bars. The problem is–particularly about doing nightlife things–my partner and I come from a place with not a lot of nightlife, so we haven't really ever been clubbing/to bars very often. We also aren't super outgoing, but we want to experience something new. It still doesn't  erase the anxiety there though haha. 

I visited Chinatown the last time we went to Chicago, and we got something to eat there, but I was also wondering if there were any recommendations for food, shopping, attractions, etc there.

I'm also open to more recommendations for pretty much anything! My only requirement would be that the environment is LGBTQ+ friendly or even LGBTQ+ owned. Although I would like to add that my budget is rather limited, so nothing super expensive.

I was also looking around a bit ago for markets to go to (preferably art markets, but farmer's markets would be interesting too!), any recommendations?

Sorry, this post is a bit of a mess. Hope this isn't too many questions. Feel free to answer only some of them if you want. Thanks in advance and let me know if you need any more information (that isn't super deeply personal LOL)

tl;dr bullet points:
- what are some gay bars you recommend for people who are (at least relatively) new to nightlife? 
- what are some things to do in Chinatown?
- what are some LGBTQ+ friendly recommendations for (cheapish) things to do?
- any markets running this weekend?",,

I'm writing to you as a humble 22 year old with my arms reaching out, fingers on keyboard, asking for solutions and mercy to help me optimize the most 'Lit' time for my first visit to Chicago this coming week(starting 31st March)!

As a bit of context, I am an energetic music/food/history/ multicultural advocator from the UK originally from South London, and have won the opportunity to go to one of my work events onsite in your glorious city, though I had only found out this weekend; so Monday march 31st to Thursday April 3rd afternoon I will not be free for any tourism/holiday activities, but have decided to extend my trip on a solo mission from Thursday to Saturday afternoon as this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. I have never been to the states nor Chicago and am super keen to try and get the most culturally rich & fun experience possible.

Currently it's looking like I've got Thursday evening, the whole of Friday and enough of Saturday before a 7pm flight home to pack in as much as I can for a flavour of that American dream.

I'm not made of money, and operating on a budget from my first proper job 1 year out of Uni,  but still looking to live it up; so i am looking to indulge in some relatively cheap but delectable food spots, preferably local/community hub style spots, any certified or lively clubs with quality music, or museums/ parks/ activities that will make me say 'phwaahh' in true British fashion and enrich my perspective on Chicago.

I'm lucky that my family put me on to some vintage Frankie Knuckles as well as Chief Keef as a young buck so i do like a bit of house/ghetto tech & modern rap, while i also am a big reggae/dub enthusiast and also mix/mc in the UK scene across dance genres - so being frank I know next to nothing about what's popping at the moment in Chicago so i would appreciate any lively suggestions :)

At this point I'm yet to pattern my Airbnb for these 2 nights Thursday and Friday, so genuinely any recommendations like a 'must do' or 'must avoid' would be really really helpful.

I appreciate I'm asking quite a bit so independently I will do a lot more research on socials and chat gpt but thought there might be some legends here who could offer some awesome insights/ first hand experience from good times in your city.

I'm coming with nothing but a humble attitude, open mind and positive vibes so if anything comes to mind or would like to message me personally please do.

Many thanks and blessings!!",,

* Architecture River Tour
* Lou Malnati's for pizza

* Art Institute of Chicago
* Take train home

UPDATE: Here's what I have planned for the second day. I think I'm sticking to my original plan on the first day but switching restaurants for dinner. Instead of 3 Arts Club, I'll make the trip out to Cindy's Rooftop:

* Lula Cafe for breakfast/brunch
* Logan Square
* Wicker Park
* Colectivo for mid-day coffee/bite

Seeking an escape from stress and loneliness due to caring for grandma full-time and being guided by a therapist to explore social options.,local,cultural,"['stress relief', 'curiosity', 'social isolation', 'cost', 'concern about wasting time', 'limited free time']","['limited free time', 'cost of activities', 'scheduling conflicts', 'group capacity issues', 'desire for in-person interaction']","['Meetup events', 'creating a new group on an app']",Therapist recommendation and realization that in-person interaction is needed.,first_time,curious,Exploring Meetup for compatible groups or events,"Driven by stress relief and a recommendation from a therapist, she considered Meetup to find social activities despite limited time and specific interests to counteract loneliness.",1j6wpio,post,AskChicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j6wpio,10,2025-03-08 19:43:57,"I hadn’t heard about Meetup until 2022.  By then I was a year into my first—and so far, ONLY—job since COVID.  I work as a home care aide for my grandma, and I love her, but the job can be stressful and lonesome.  My therapist recommended Meetup to me, and it seemed like a good idea.

However, I guess I’m a little picky about my interests and not as open-minded to new ones.  But I have so little free time on my hands, that I don’t wanna risk trying something new, only to not enjoy it, and then immediately going back to work regretting the time I wasted.
Some groups and events also require you to pay to join.  So I’d REALLY hate to waste time doing something I’d end up not enjoying, especially if I had to pay money for it.

And the activities and hobbies that I do enjoy don’t have a lot of groups set up for them.  And if they do have groups, they’re either filled up already, they conflict with my schedule, or they’re only done online—which would be fine, but I’m tired of trying to meet and talk to new people through screens.

I tried doing some deep searching for something to do and somewhere to go today. But whatever was available didn’t interest me, and whatever interested me wasn’t available.

And now I’m hearing tales of people joining groups and events only for them to get canceled at the last moment, no one showing up, or people in these groups being flaky.

Has anybody had luck with Meetup?  Are there other apps and websites I can try to join social events and groups for free—or at least low cost?

Edit: March 22, 2025
I would start a group of my own through one of these apps, but I don’t know what that entails other than coming up with a name, time, and address.
Should I also have food and drinks prepared for the guests?  How do I convince people to WANT to join instead of just hoping they show up?",,

I have been accepted to a graduate program at Northwestern. In a few weeks, I'll be coming in to the city for an admitted student event, during which I hope to schmooze with some other potential students in my cohort, chat with current students, etc.

I will be in the city Thursday-Monday (March 13-18 if that matters) and have a fair amount of downtime to get a feel of the city. I'm just trying to form an agenda on what/where I should check out while I'm here. At this time, I am NOT looking to do tourist-y things, so I don't need any advice in regards to that. I'm more looking to get a feel of neighborhoods that may be good options for me, in terms of commute, housing logistics, and ""vibes,"" so to speak.

Despite its proximity to campus, I'm unsure if Evanston is right for me, although I hear conflicting things about what it offers to people with similar identities and interests to me (boring? sways younger?). Things about me to consider in terms of lifestyle:

* I am a gay female nearing my 30s and would really like to live near other young professionals and a nice queer scene would be cool, even if it's small. I also am quite leftist politically and would appreciate living in a more liberal area.
* I will not have a car when I move and I'd love to not need one.
* I imagine I will have to live with a roommates(s) and my budget is \~1300/mo. However, if I can afford a studio/1br with that budget as well, that's great. I am pursuing a doctoral degree fulltime. For income, at least at first, I will almost certainly be doing some kind of service work outside of school hours (i.e. bartending) and don't know how that will work out.
* Unsure about preferred amenities. I \*love\* hustle and bustle, so noise doesn't bother me. I like lots of options for things to do and would prefer to not have to travel more than 20-30 minutes to find them.
   * In terms of ""things to do:"" I don't like nightclubs, but I like bars. I currently attend and occasionally perform at an acoustic open mic at a bar near me and find that to be a staple of my social life, and would love something similar fairly close to me. Things in the past I've been excited to be near/a part of: theme park, public library, a roller derby team (both as a spectator and an athlete... y'all have a team, I'm just putting it out there to give you an idea), climbing gyms, dedicated barbell gyms, circus arts school, magic theatre/workshops, independent film theaters, and community theatre.
* I currently live in Boston and regularly deal with commute times both to work and play of anywhere between 30-60 minutes. Even though most things are only within 5 miles of each other, public transit often takes an average of 45 minutes to move between them.
   * Putting this out there just to say a long(er) commute isn't a dealbreaker (I hate it, but it isn't ruining my life), but I'd prefer something <30 if that's realistic. I bike, too, and enjoy that, and could pick that up here too as a commute option if that makes more sense ultimately.

I honestly don't even know how to determine if a neighborhood would be a good fit. A friend recommended things along the red line for me-- Andersonville, and Edgewater, and also said that Lincoln Park, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, and Wicker Park could be good. I also saw that living along the purple line would be convenient too for Northwestern... what's the difference? It seems you'd have to transfer from the red to the purple to get to Northwestern, but my understanding is there is a Northwestern-specific shuttle that runs from either the red or purple line-- I saw a comment somewhere but I can't find it now and forget the specifics... Is anyone familiar with the shuttle, and if so, is it faster? Seems that the neighborhoods I've mentioned are still \~50 mins to campus if you take ""conventional"" public transit-- I have been looking at google maps and it can't tell me time tables for private bus options like a shuttle.

Anywhere I've lived, I've just made do. But I'd like to make a more targeted decision now. That being said, please let me know if theres an area that you believe aligns with any of these things! And if you have a fav restaurant/cafe/bespoke lil shop/cafe/open mic (on a night I'm here)/independent film theatre, etc. in or near these neighborhoods, do let me know!

Thank you for your time and attention! Sorry this is so long.",,

I plan to arrive on March 4th, but I need to be at NEIU on the 5th, and then I will try to decide when to fly back. If it's too cold for sightseeing, I might visit downtown for a day on the 6th and then fly back on the 7th. Otherwise, I could fly back on Saturday for more time to visit. I'm visiting from San Jose, CA, and here are my questions:

\- How cold is it? Is the wind terrible at this time of year? It was 65 degrees in San Jose this afternoon, and the coldest is around 40 degrees in the mornings. I can bundle up, but I don't know if I will be miserable.

\- Will it be too cold to go sightseeing downtown or do the river tour? Walk around the buildings and museums. I love art and would love to visit the Art Institute. It looks like it could be super cool to do the Chicago Architecture Tour: Underground Pedway and the Loop (I found it on Tripadvisor)

\- Is taking the train from the NEIU area to downtown Chicago easy and safe? Or should I book a hotel downtown, stay there for a wo days, and walk around?

I'm not rich, so it may not be anything fancy. But I grew up cooking and can make meals that'll be easy to transport and can be made in larger quantities (ex: lasagna/most pastas, chicken, mashed potatoes, casseroles, taco tray).

I'd most likely try to make 1 homemade meal donation a week or every two weeks to start out, as this is my first time doing something like this. For anyone who's interested please be within 2 miles if you'd like it delivered, or be able to pick up from West Loop area. Also, if you're interested and the food will be for more than one person, say how many people are your in family/residence :) I'll probably start this sometime next week or the week after.

Also, more importantly, what's really going on at Roosevelt Station/nearby area? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. In case it isn't clear, I don't think anything of Chicago besides it's lovely and like any other major city. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what I've read on Reddit and was trying to offset the ridiculous nature of this post with humor!

UPDATE 2.0: **Final update, I promise.** I just wanted to say thanks again–y’all are really kind and reading your experiences has been very helpful. *Thanks for being my grain*s *of salt!* **If any of y’all in the South Loop (or nearby) want some new friends, DM me if you're interested in meeting up. My partner and I don't know anyone in Chicago and are starting from scratch.** Thanks again everyone!

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx).

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station–i.e. is it self-contained?–or is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read.

PS. Yes, we're going to visit in person, but visiting is very different than living. So, if you have lived experience, that's what we're hoping to read/understand.

THANKS Y'ALL!",,

Recently though (last couple months), it's been so obnoxious to not only get an Uber/Lyft, but the quality of the driving has gotten worse too, I've literally started taking the taxis outside my apartment now just to avoid Uber/Lyft at this point.

Firstly, I live downtown, which you'd think with it being the third largest city in America, would make it pretty quick to get a ride, but the wait times have gone up and have been less accurate (arriving in ""5 minutes"" is almost always at least 10). On top of that, it's been tracking the cars a worse. First they're across the street -nope, now it's flying to 5 blocks away -ope, nvm, theyre on the other side of the building -actually the second time was right 🙄

Secondly, it's been directing them to lower Wacker to get to me way more often and it's significantly impacted the driver's ability to even get to me. I get this is probably an underlying maps update or something since it seems to affect both Uber and Lyft, but I've been doing Ubers downtown for a long time -even pre-installing cell service under there (total nightmare before) and it's never been THIS many times consistently that drivers can't even get to me. This has also lead to more drivers cancelling or calling me to ask where I am when they're in Lower Wacker. I've been having to budget 20 minutes MINIMUM from ""request ride"" to getting in the car now to account for these issues.

Thirdly, after the battle to even get a ride, so many more times the driving is super jerky with their driving and/or there's a nauseating scent in the car, so by the time I get to my stop, I feel nauseous, which is not how I wanna feel after being dropped off.

I've been taking Ubers since there were cards to ""download and try this new app!"" and added Lyft more recently in the past couple years too, but the combination of longer wait times, inability to reliably even get to me or track the cars, increased cancels, and lower quality driving has FINALLY pushed me away from it being my main way to get around with a car. It's just not worth it. I'm lucky that there are taxis around because there's 0 wait time, the rides are smoother/smell better, and honestly it's even been CHEAPER than Uber/Lyft sometimes and just sooooo much easier to use at this point.

I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this quality going down too and have decided alternatives are now a better option.

EDIT: i have a 4.91 rating on uber and i can't seem to find a lyft rating, but have the ""five-star rider"" badge with 150+ ratings. while i appreciate all the mentions to rating, like i said, i've been using uber since it came to chicago in 2012, so i am aware of the ratings and their impact too. i've never been mean to a driver (grew up in small town WI and am ""midwest nice""), but sometimes i trail off a conversation if i clearly don't want to talk and they try to force conversation, sorry 🤷‍♀️",,

* Good blues club that is not 21+
* Chinese hot pot restaurant favorites
* Museums that might engage a teen...other than science or animals, it'd have to be <1/2 day or she'd lose interest I think
* A great arcade or (even better) a place to eat that has an arcade or carnival type games (like Chuck-E-Cheese, but not CEC)
* Some slightly off-the-wall activities
* If we could nab tickets to a show last minute we'd do it...preferably a smaller venue
* Any reviews of the Colosseum? [https://www.theannoyance.com/show/colosseum](https://www.theannoyance.com/show/colosseum) I think she might get into a philosophical comedy...as long as it's not too raunchy to have your dad with you",,

Things to note:

* We both live in the Chicagoland area, so I'd be looking for something in the nicer downtown areas (Naperville, Geneva, Oakbrook, etc), or potentially downtown as a second resort if worthwhile.
* We are both in our late teens, so drinking/clubs/bars is not an option (though if we can get in and just get food thats viable)
* She absolutely loves sunsets. I'm thinking to potentially utilize this in my planning.
* I have a nice car, so the idea of a night drive has been in my back pocket, though as for where I'd go or what we'd do is where I'm stumped. Hard to find a nice hilltop view overlooking the city since we are mainly on flatland.
* Nicer restaurants with a romantic environment or city view are an option. RH Rooftop was solid, The Turf Room in Aurora was nice, Gejas cafe had a nice vibe but terrible food imo, something along those lines are what I like. Been wanting to try The Tao for a minute, though I don't know if she likes asian food.
* The approach I want to take is basically ""dont worry about where we're going. just be ready at 'insert time' and dress pretty for me"". Dressed up, greeting her at the door with flowers in hand, potentially greeting her dad so he doesnt think im a pos lol, opening the car door for her, and going from there.

I'm sure majority of you are older than I am and have a lot more experience with dating/the area so I would love some input as to what you'd advise, or some romantic moments you've had in the past! Thanks in advance.",,

I have a friend whom I'm staying with, he lives in Logan Square. Dates are September 20 - 22. I am looking for your advice on how to make the most of the visit.

Here are my broad objectives. I will compare them to my experience in Boston, as a reference point.
* Get a ground-level understanding of the different neighborhoods. A combination of walking, riding bikes, or taking transit (train, or bus as needed) will be ideal. Reference point: I rode the T branches to find different neighborhoods. It made it easy to find out relative distances between things and neighborhoods. Further out from the bustle was nice.
* Understand density of infrastructure, services, and businesses. Ones that are important to me include: grocery stores, parking, EV charging (ideally at an apartment/condo), solid ethnic food, and access to nature/park and green areas. I chose the Brookline/Brighton area for its greenery. Cambridge was cool as well, but very pricey.
* Check out housing options and configurations. I won't have roommates, but I can spend a good deal on rent. Primarily looking for clean (no bugs), safe, and functional place. A resident lot or parking structure would work for me especially if it's got charging. At the time in Boston I had a company gas car, but street parking was cool. Wish I had better Internet, though.
* Get a sense of community. Where are people hanging out? What do they do for fun? I enjoyed kayaking down the Esplanade, biking through Cambridge, and hanging out in the Common. Grabbing a beer at a hole in the wall bar is always fun.

If I'm missing anything, please let me know. Thank you for the advice!",,

There aren’t many “freebies”. They had samples of Starry (pop), Keifer (drinkable yogurt), full sized bags of dog treats from Jewel and free cans of San Pellegrino but that’s all I came across today.

I will be making the drive from my hometown, but I plan on just ubering longer distances for the two days I'll be in. So that leads to a bevy of questions. 

Night 1 is easy-- get in, check in, go to the show. 

Day 2 is where I want to enjoy as much as I can of Chicago for the brief time I'm there, which in my mind, means walking quite a bit.

There's the Bean, which is a must, and 1.5 miles north is an observatory at 875 N Michigan. In between, or around the area, I'm not sure what else to do. But that's about where I'd like to kick it around.

1) Elephant in the room.. Is it a real bitch to have to walk about 20min/a mile in the cold? Or do people just make a big deal about it because it's the meme? Avg temps for Dec 11-13 is 37H/22L.

2) I don't want to start a war, so I'll ask for your top 5 places to get a slice of Chicago deep dish (that's the style, right?) pizza in the downtown area? Or is there a great place serving some other iconic Chicago cuisine reasonably nearby?

3) I'm seeing a couple of museums in the area (gotta go to the Chicago Sports Museum). Is there anything else where I might be able to waste an hour or so?

4) I'm not huge on clubbing, but I can have a good time at a pub or sports bar. Any suggestions on that front? What about an ultra late nightcap?

Fuck ketchup.

So far on our list we’re interested in checking out the international museum of surgical science, the medieval torture museum, and the field museum.

Does it makes sense to rely on the train (or other public transit) to check these places out or would i be better off driving?

Ive driven in and out of chicago a few times for shows, but this will be the first time im actually exploring the city and the train sounded fun.

Any tips and other recommendations (like food or other oddities!) for stuff in those areas is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",,

# Neighborhoods

**Lakeview**:

Seattle equivalent: A much larger Wallingford.

Very busy area with a younger 20-30'ish crowd. Lots of dog owners and plenty of restaurants, bars, and businesses to hang out at.

**Lincoln Park:**

Seattle equivalent: Ravenna

Close to Lakeview which is nice but appears to be a more affluent area. Seems to have a very slightly older crowd (25-30) than Lakeview but that makes sense given the cost of living there. Centrally located between Downtown and Lakeview while still close to the Lake makes it a nice destination for those who don't mind paying a bit more of a premium.

**Wrigley Field**:

Seattle equivalent: University District

Seems much more affordable while still being reasonably close to the rest of the Chicago neighborhoods. Hence it makes sense that it appears to draw a much younger crowd of college age kids.

**Logan Square:**

Seattle equivalent: Ballard

A bit hipster-ish but feels like a mini Lakeview with less crowds. Nice area if you like to live in the city but don't like to feel like you're surrounded by the city.

**Fulton Market**

Seattle equivalent: Fremont

Neat little area with lots of restaurants and bars but not much else outside of the Fulton Market itself. I don't see any particular reason to live there since you can commute to Fulton Market when you want to hang out there. Commuting anywhere (e.g. Lakeview or even Logan Square) is a bit of a ride as everything requires a transfer to another line.

**West Loop:**

Seattle equivalent: Northgate

Not much to do here other than going to Fulton Market. This area is also where you start to notice signs of gentrification as there is a good mix of new modern apartments mixed with older and abandoned lots. There really isn't a sense of physical danger living here other than petty level type crimes.

**The Loop:**

Seattle equivalent: Downtown Seattle

Not sure why anyone would personally want to live here unless they cared about distance to work. Nothing to do here after business hours and everyone goes home.

# Activities:

**Beach Volleyball:**

I got to sub for a team in beach volleyball which was a blast. Highly recommend trying to find a league to join. Personally still looking to join a volleyball or kickball league.

**Walking**:  
There are so many parks and trails in Chicago that are beautiful to walk through in the summer. You'll find people walking or hanging out in the nice summer weather. The [Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tyNmhZXw3sbYXxJc8) is one of my personal favorites. There also appear to be a lot of running clubs but that's not my kind of thing.

**Bicycling**:

There are plenty of places that you can rent a bicycle and the 606 is a highly popular trail though I personally haven't been on it myself yet. Since this region is so flat, it makes biking a breeze.

**Lincoln Park Zoo:**

A free zoo that is very large and plenty of fun to walk through. No pets allowed though.

**Riverboat Architecture Tour:**

Super fun and awesome to learn about all the buildings along the river. Learn some fun facts that you can impress your friends with when they visit.

**Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary:**  
So many cool birds that you can see while you walk through a very peaceful and secluded park that almost makes you forget that you're in the middle of Chicago.

**The Art Institute of Chicago:**

Cool museum if you're into that kind of stuff. The surrounding area is definitely worth checking out although you cannot see the Bean at this time.

**Comedy Clubs:**

Visited the Laugh Factory and got to see a skit. Seems fun and there are lots of amateur classes where you can meet others.

# Restaurants ([Link to Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ak4XYjddK2uBqG6N6)):

Background:

I’m a consultant from southeast MI. I have not lived in the US my entire life. In my early twenties. I had an opportunity to visit Orland Park, IL for some consulting work. I took it and decided to spend the weekend in Chicago, which was my first time. I’m also a huge fan of the game, Watchdogs. Which helped me navigate a bit lol. 


As we were entering Lake Shore Dr into the city, I saw this beautiful collection of skyscrapers with a cloud above them. And it began to rain right away. 

I instantly fell in love with everything about this city. I was feeling nostalgic while I was in it. I love everything from the name “The Loop” [which I just love saying any chance I get]. To the vibe, people, diversity, just, everything about it. 


RELEVANT TO THE QUESTION:

I’ve gone to the two towers for a high view of the city, tried Lou and Giordano’s, riverwalk, navy pier, etc etc….

I want to make my visit to Chicago a semiannual or more type thing. What do you think I can do there that’s less usual for new tourists to dive into? Like hidden gems or even suburbs?

You may see some activity all night, but it will probably be low and on the northern horizon until sunrise.

As of right now (4:30pm) NOAA's [SWPC](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) is still predicting a good show tonight:

https://preview.redd.it/shig19ei8vzc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=377cc38b3a23aa1997a8467b48b907773fdc63ee

But currently there is very little auroral activity over Europe:

And energy levels have been dropping all day:

https://preview.redd.it/t4myw7zb8vzc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=198285b8f14751186174095a53c255c4f449ca1b

So that must mean the NOAA SPC is expecting more energy from the CME to hit the Earth in the next few hours. That's based on data from satellites and such added to model simulations - not direct observation. Super useful, but not 100% certain. Its like when the weather models predict something but looking out the window you just don't see it (""it's not verifying"" in meteorology parlance).

That makes it a very tough decision to make for this evening. Personally, we are still going to go out. We have a large group of people and are making it a social event so even if there isn't a show we'll have fun. We are driving north to a forest preserve. But honestly, if it was just me and the family we would probably keep our plans free but stay home and wait for reports from others.

BTW, the SWPC just issued a warning for **tomorrow** (lots of people on social media are thinking this is for tonight) that there could be a very large geomagnetic  storm in the morning. That means that we wouldn’t see anything at the time, of course. But if it persisted until the evening, we could have another good show tomorrow night at sunset.

Context: My s.o. birthday is coming up and he's the type to buy whatever he needs or wants right then and there, so I've had to return quite a few things.
He loves hands on and new experiences! Unfortunately due to our conflicting work schedules, we can only really spare a day, and he's not the type to go to alone.

Some of his interests:
- building things (loves building furniture from scratch, etc)
- leatherwork (something he wants to get into but never tried)
- coffee (has a coffee passport book +  monthly coffee bean subscription)
- food (he loves cooking but does it daily so he'd prefer if he didn't have to cook on his off day)
- fashion (hates shopping, but cares about looking his best)
-fitness (he's pretty active, but I am not so please be gentle with your suggestions LOL)

Things to note:
- he gets cold easily so he'd prefer an indoor activity 
- he gets motion sick/vertigo so nothing like height related or like anything like the boat tours
- we do have a car, so driving a bit further out isn't an issue",,

I've been a Chicago resident for nine years total now. I went to a Midwestern state school, so drinking and partying were really the only kind of socialization I knew.

I went sober in 2022. Through 2023 I've found myself able to go to the normal Chicago clubbing/party/bar events no problem... but it's all lost its fun to me. There's only so many times you can go out and listen to the same music on the same dance floors over and over with people stumbling into you until you're like ""alright, it's midnight, I'm ready to sleep."" I'm a huge music head, though, and the one thing that keeps me excited for Chicago is the wide array of musicians that come through. But that's really only a once/twice-a-month thing now. 

I love doing ACTIVE things, and Chicago isn't really known for that. Wanna hike. Snowboard. Surf. Mountain Bike. A hill or two wouldn't go amiss in the city. 

Has anyone else experienced this? It's such a vibrant and fun city, but culturally it's so centered on drinking. What're y'all doing if you're not drinking?",,

My coworker and friend Ryu is a Japanese national here on a 5 year work visa.  9 months after his arrival his wife and children finally joined him right here in Chicagoland.  Last week Ryu took his wife to the St. Charles DMV to take her driving test.

As she was taking the written test, she pulled out a Japanese to English dictionary.  Apparently the written test supports other languages like Spanish, Polish, Chinese, and a few others - but not Japanese.  Since nowadays everything is under video surveillance, a DMV employee noticed she was using a book - approached Ryu's wife, raised their voice to her, stopped the test, and dismissed her from the DMV.  Ryu's wife cried for 3 days.

Ryu did the right thing by contacting the DMV from the IDOT website.  They informed Ryu that the DMV employee was correct in that no books are allowed during the written exam.  In spite of this, they will try again with the Japanese to English dictionary this Saturday at a more urban DMV location.

My question is is how do I help my friend and coworker with this situation.  Thank you for your time.",,

I wanted to learn at the iO, get auditions, do stand up in an amazing scene, and make something of myself other than being some crappy salesman. I went into several depressive episodes in that time because I never felt like I was using my time here wisely (because I was too busy being depressed), and I knew I was giving up time with my family and friends back home. When pandemic hit, I stuck it out here but eventually realized it would be a long time before the arts returned, so I moved home. I felt like I was ripped from Chicago against my will. 

After a year, I returned to try and pick up the pieces. Improv was dead, but stand up was around. I would go to different open mics trying out new material or new concept alt comedy (I would do a one man improvised musical set), but ultimately I sucked. After I was at a mic where a guy threatened the comics, I said enough. I lost my identity and it was rough. 

Until I went to my first music open mic. 

I'm a multinstrumentalist with a minor in jazz. I ended up connecting with amazing people who WANTED to see me succeed. In stand up, people tend to step on each other- I had a culture shock. I spent a year in the scene while working a day job, but after getting the opportunity to be a long term music sub at a Catholic school I had a foot in the door of being a professional musician. I now host several music jams, have released music, have a band, teach private lessons and various daycares in the city. I am getting paid much more than any tech startup or sales pit paid me. I feel like I know my worth now. I'm now getting hired to score for a television show that is already streaming. 

And it's been 5 years since I left my home. I never meant to be away this long, but now I'm seeing my friends and family move on with their lives without me. It's really hard, but I feel like I'm finally getting traction here. 

I know when I move I'll miss Chicago deeply. That's the problem with having two places you call home- you're always homesick.",,

I’m queer myself and am from the DC area, and felt like I was a part of the queer community there. I moved to Gold Coast (which I know is bougie and was not on the list of places recommended to me by various friends in regards to moving to Chicago as a queer person), and I’m kind of regretting it. There are certainly worse places to live as a queer person, but I really do feel out of place here and feel that I should’ve moved more north. I work in tech and have no friends here outside of coworkers, who are ALL straight men (I’m a very visibly queer woman). That being said, I have zero queer people in my life in this city and it’s really wearing down on me. I have no problem with straight people and have many straight friends back home, but I’m sick of being in a group of straight tech bros who say slightly homophobic shit all day. Does anybody have any advice for integrating myself into the community and making some queer friends around here? I know I got myself into this by moving to Gold Coast, but it’s too late to change that and am looking to do what I can, because it’s getting pretty lonely and discouraging. In a happy loving relationship with someone in another city, just trying to make some new friends so I don’t have to be biting my tongue every time I go out with my accepting but still ignorant friends.

I’m not shy and am looking to get more acquainted with this awesome city in general, so I really appreciate the suggestions!! Everyone in the comments has been very helpful and kind, really appreciate the camaraderie here.

Edit: So glad I asked, seems like there are many lovely folks here who are welcoming to newcomers wanting to integrate themselves into the community.  The responses here are really reassuring and make me excited to explore Chicago more and meet some new people (which I’ve learned there are many ways to do). Thank you all!!

Edit: Sexuality is definitely not the only thing that matters, I have lots of straight friends back home and like connecting with people in general. I simply am in a workplace that is a less tolerant environment, and since I’ve only been here for two months and work is the only place I’ve met people thus far, I’m just looking for advice to branch out. Gay bars and organizations exist for a reason - they’re not for people obsessed with their identity. They’re for people to have a place where they know they won’t have to deal with homophobia, which I currently have to deal with more than I’d like. Many of my best friends are straight, I’m simply looking for places in a new city where I know I’ll be accepted, because I don’t have that in my current social circle.",,

This year we chose Chicago as our destination. I went to Chicago for the first time in late 2021 and really fell in love with the city. I’ve been to other major cities in the U.S. but Chicago has a certain charm to it that is a little hard for me to pinpoint. It’s like a city environment that doesn’t have a feeling of being extremely overcrowded.

The purpose of this post is to share the things we did as tourists to maybe help future tourists gain some ideas for things to try. Also, if any locals want to share things for future Chicago visits, please let us know.

To start, we stayed from Friday 8/25 to Sunday 8/27. We flew in and out of Midway. We purchased the 3 day CTA pass for $15 per person when we arrived at Midway. During the trip we almost exclusively used CTA and had no negative experiences. The CTA was extremely user-friendly and we did not encounter any situations where we felt unsafe. We used 3 Ubers throughout our time there, but we only used them  because we needed to cut down the travel time to our next destination slightly or it was too late for CTA. We also used Metra once. I’ve seen it in this sub before, but if you’re planning a trip here, there is no reason to rent a car. The public transit is a bargain and very effective.

We stayed at The Freehand Chicago at 19 E Ohio St. 

**Places we ate:**

Wildberry Pancakes and Café at 130 E Randolph St.

Frontera Grill at 445 N Clark St.

Goddess and the Baker at 44 E Grand Ave.

Ja’ Grill Hyde Park at 1510 E Harper Ct

Pequod’s Pizza 2207 N Clybourn Ave.

RAMEN-SAN at 59 W Hubbard St #2.

Al’s #1 Italian Beef at 548 N Wells St.

I'm not going to go in depth on each place, but I will say that we did not have a bad meal while we were there. When I come back, I would definitely go back to any of these spots.

**Activities we did:**

Walked along the Lake Shore

Explored Millennium Park

Shopped at Exile in Bookville (book store)

The Chicago Music Exchange

Chicago River Architecture Tour through Shoreline Sightseeing

Skydeck Chicago in the Willis Tower

The Museum of Science and Industry

A stand-up comedy show at the Laugh Factory

The Art Institute of Chicago

Now that I’m writing it out, the list of activities doesn't seem like much, but we had a lot of fun and had virtually zero downtime. I feel like we really took advantage of our time and got the most we could out of a weekend trip.

A tip to other tourists planning a trip, locals looking to suggest an option to visiting family members or even to use themselves. We used an online service called “CityPass.” CityPASS services multiple cities, with Chicago being one of them. The Chicago CityPass was $136 per person with tax and gave us access to 5 different attractions from a designated list. The Shedd Aquarium and Skydeck Chicago were required and then we were able to choose 3 more activities from this list; The Field Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Science and Industry, The Adler Planetarium, 360 Chicago Observation Deck, and Shoreline Sightseeing Architecture River Tour.

I assumed when purchasing the CityPASS tickets that they would just be base level tickets with no extra perks. To my surprise, the tickets gave us expedited entry to Skydeck Chicago and a free 30 minute movie at the Museum of Science and Industry. I will definitely use this service again in the future. Due to time constraints, we didn't get a chance to check out Shedd Aquarium.

To close, we walked approximately 60,000 steps over these 3 days. A lot of those steps occurred on the public streets, through CTA stations and inside of the attractions we visited. Minus one homeless guy at the base of the Willis Tower (an outlier in my opinion), not once did we feel unsafe. We had a great experience and left knowing that there is so much more to explore and learn about the city.

Basically as the title says. I've lived here for a year and some change now and I can't seem to make any friends. On paper, I feel like I've done everything right. I've gotten to know my coworkers, I've joined various social groups, such as rec sports leagues, hobby groups, etc. I've tried a few different dating apps. I've gone plenty of places alone (museums, restaurants, gyms, etc.) with an open mindset. None of these have worked out. 

Despite being friendly with my coworkers, anytime I've suggested doing something outside of work with them, they haven't been interested. In over a year of working there I don't think any of them have ever had the slightest interest in doing anything outside of work with anyone else at the company. Just not really the vibe or the culture at that company I guess. 

In all the rec sports leagues I've been in, everyone cuts off communication as soon as the league ends. Attempts to invite people to do things towards the end of the league such as bar trivia, karaoke, ball games, or other group activities of that kind have never gotten people to commit to it (or if they have, all of them cancel the day of and then ghost the group). 

I'm a very average looking person, so dating apps have only served to damage my mental health without ever having any success (and yes, I've had friends (that don't live here) help me set them up before in case I include anything that's unconsciously offputting). 

Hobby groups meet very seldomly, and usually don't have many of the same members between meetings, making it very difficult to build lasting relationships. Going to places alone hasn't led to anything either, other than to highlight how lonely I am and how much I wish I had other people to do things with. Feels like most people met their friends through mutual friends. Since I didn't know a single person in Chicago when I moved here, that hasn't been an option for me. 

I'm a pretty friendly person overall. I try and stay hi to people I know, learn people's names, get to know them as best I'm able. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Feels like everyone here already has a pre-existing friend group and just doesn't want to expand it at all. I've struggled with mental health for years and the constant crushing loneliness and feelings of being unwanted has really pushed me to the edge. I won't last another year. I know this post is sad and pathetic, but I'm tired of spending every Friday night in my apartment because I just don't have anything better to do. Hoping someone has some advice or maybe can suggest something that I never thought of. I just don't know what else to do. Thanks in advance!",,

Last night we got home from our week long vacation to Chicago. We've never been there before, and it is far and away the largest city I've ever been to (previously the Twin Cities). We live in a ~60,000 population city in your next door neighbor, Iowa.

Right off the bat: WOW. I loved it. We stayed at the Radisson Blu at the Aqua tower. On the 16th floor, overlooking N Columbus Dr.

We didn't do a TON of research beforehand on places to eat, but here is a list of a few of them:

Mr. Beef (inspiration of The Bear on FX)

Giordano's (I've never had authentic Chicago deep dish) 

Eggy's diner

Pancake Cafe Wrigleyville

Various food trucks (Chicago dogs!)

McDonald's (forgive me - we have 3 kids lol)

A few other notes about the trip:

HOLY FUCK THE TRAFFIC. I have never been so intimidated by traffic before in my life. I used to think Minnesota/Twin Cities drivers are the most aggressive/fast, but they don't hold a candle to Chicago drivers. In the entire week, I think I was only honked at 2 or 3 times, so I consider that a victory. I also did not honk at anyone, because I was a mere visitor and didn't feel like I deserve to honk at anyone - despite there being SEVERAL opportunities to do so!
**Honest question** - I saw so few police cars out and about - does the CPD care at all about traffic violations?

The Field Museum was way better than Shedd. We could have spent two full days at Field, but I was kind of bored with Shedd after a few hours. Again, for the kids. haha

Architectural Boat Tour was incredible. I wish we could have done it at night.

Navy Pier was not enjoyable for me - just way too many people.

I'll wrap this up. I love Chicago. I loved the energy. Right when we got there last Monday night, we got out and walked after being in the car for 6+ hours, got a Chicago Dog at Millennium Park, and as I sat there looking at all the sights, it just hit me about what an incredible city this is. And while I could never see myself living there, I will definitely be back.

Oh and FUCK all the ""DoN't GeT mUrDeReD!!!"" people - I never once felt unsafe or uneasy about any place we were at. I've felt uneasy in parts of rural Iowa compared to downtown Chicago. 

I'm gonna flair this as AMA because go ahead, ask me questions as a first time visitor!

Thank you Chicago!!!",,

She didn’t say a word though, just pointed one direction then the other and was like leaning against the corner apartment building.

I pointed in the direction the numbers were increasing in and said if you are looking for this address on this street, it’s that direction. She just like stared at me then pointed in the opposite direction then the direction I was pointing. She was looking majorly confused and so was I. I nodded. Then we kind of broke apart and I walked on. 

I can’t get her face out of my head though.

**THURSDAY**

Landed at O’Hare and for $15 we each got a ticket for 3 days of unlimited rides train/bus.  What a deal and a great welcome!

Took train toward the loop, stopping at Oiistar Ramen in Wicker Park on the way. 

Walk from our hotel (Hyatt) to the Cloud Gate Bean then to the Art Institute.  My GF is a nurse and I half-jokingly asked if there are any discounts available for her, and the amazing attendant straight up comp’d her ticket!  We loved the museum.

Giordano's N Rush Street. Maybe this was an off-night (?), but we didn’t care for it at all.  Crust was flavorless. 

John Hancock tower Signature Room drinks for amazing views.  


**FRIDAY** 

Bongo Room brunch – I *love* the pancakes here, my God…  Walked around Wicker Park.

Bus over to Lincoln Park near where the fighter jet planes were practicing (so cool), then walked up to the zoo.  We spent so long looking at the primates and thought it was so great that the zoo is free. 

Chicago architecture river cruise.  [This was my favorite building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Regis_Chicago) on the tour (edited OP to add this detail).

RHCP concert at Soldier Field.  Concert was fire (any fellow Frusciante fanatics?) but I also really loved being able to see Soldier Field for the first time.  Hope to catch a Bears game sometime.   


**SATURDAY**

It rained early so I was worried we wouldn’t get to experience Wrigley but was only an hour delay.  Cubs won vs Milwaukee in a back & forth game with a walk off single!  

Uber to Pequod’s.  I loved this pizza.  Thought it was way better than Giordano's.  Next trip we’ll try Lou Malnati’s.

Your city is *AWESOME*.  We all absolutely loved it.  I’m a longtime New Yorker and at this point in my life (late 30s), I think I prefer Chicago.  Still a big city with tons to do but a little bit more relaxed, not absolutely overflowing with people everywhere you go, and so so much cheaper.

The area by Roscoe's tends to attract more the drinking crowd. The area in front of Hydrate attracts the ""stay up all weekend"" crowd. This crowd will also do the Circuit Mom parties. If you're not doing the circuit parties and want to stay out, I'd recommend heading up to Andersonville and going to places like SoFo Tap, Meeting House and other places on Clark.

I'll find some book I want to read and put a hold on it, but instead of having it shipped to my local branch (Bezazian or Edgewater, for the record) I'll just leave it at the local library it's at, and then head out there to pick it up.

Some neighborhoods are more residential or just not hopping places with a ton to do on a ""field trip,"" and so there can be a bit of awkwardness about ""why are you here?"" but if I've got some goal, it's all good. So then just the process of getting there, riding on the bus making tons of stops all along the street, I get to see just kinda... what's out there, what's it like, maybe run across some stuff by accident and pop in and now hey, got somewhere I might want to return.

Also often I'll take CTA out there, but then instead of just getting the bus back, I'll walk back at least part of the way so I can stop in places on the street and take it even slower.

Mostly I just like to have some goal if I'm going out somewhere I've not been. And the library is a handy goal.

I kind of stopped pursuing a lot of my nerdier hobbies (video games mostly), only one I really have is I play Yugioh. The Chicago scene is pretty competitive, I got top 32 at last year's nationals in Austin (3000 players). When it comes to card games in general I can attest that the individual scenes absolutely make or break the hobby. Some card shops that host Yugioh here have a few women, trans and nonbinary people (and those are the best because the diversity makes everyone more comfortable) but mostly the game is male-dominated and with that comes a wide variety of men (mostly ages 17-33). I will say the best players do tend to be the most well-adjusted guys, friendly and talkative, but there are weirdos who occasionally stumble in and they make the environment worse for everyone.

I like to draw a lot so I go to coffee shops in my free time to do some commissions on my iPad. I think nerdy guys are everywhere, you just need to approach them wherever they are. I will say, you should want to meet them somewhere you'd already want to be, don't force it. Like, if you want to meet people who are into comics, you better already like comics or want to learn. If you want some other suggestions, I can give you my perspective. I want a girl who is artistic so I go to art meetups and events. There was an art gallery in Ravenswood last week, went to that, most weeks I go to Eli Tea Bar in Andersonville on Thursdays they have a art night where people bring their various crafts and work on them.

And side note: let me ask you a question, what kind of bars are straight women typically going to?

We were really struggling with where to grab dinner on Monday with soooo many of the popular places closed so 3 Arts Cafe is a good choice since it is open 7 days a week.  We ended up booking Alinea that night for the same reason (open every day).  We also looked at SKY and Le Bouchon.  

It seems most recommend London House rooftop or Cindy’s for drinks.  We are staying at the Palmer House who also seems a good place for drinks and they are credited with inventing the brownie so definitely have to try that!

Here are a few:**

* Go on a Architecture River Boat Tour. The most popular companies are [Wendella,](https://www.wendellaboats.com/) [Shoreline Sightseeing](https://shorelinesightseeing.com/) and the [Chicago Architecture Center](https://www.architecture.org/tours/detail/chicago-architecture-center-river-cruise-aboard-chicago-s-first-lady/).

* Go to an observation deck. The most prominent are the [Skydeck at the Sears (Willis) Tower](https://theskydeck.com/) and [360 Chicago at 875 North Michigan Avenue (AKA The John Hancock Center).](https://360chicago.com/)

* Take a stroll along the Chicago Riverwalk. There are many shops and cafes here as well!

* Visit a museum! Chicago has some of the best museums in the US. The most popular are the [Art Institute](https://www.artic.edu/), the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/), the [Chicago History Museum](https://www.chicagohistory.org/) and the [Museum of Science & Industry,](https://www.msichicago.org/) but there are tons of smaller museums all across the city, such as the [McCormick Bridgehouse and Chicago River Museum](https://www.bridgehousemuseum.org/) on the Riverwalk.

* If you want to check out multiple of Chicago’s most famous attractions, consider getting a [CityPass](https://www.citypass.com/chicago) during your visit.

* Like animals? The [Lincoln Park Zoo](https://www.lpzoo.org/) is one of the few remaining free zoos in the country. For aquatic animals, the [Shedd Aquarium](https://www.sheddaquarium.org/) is a great (albeit not free) place to see fish and other sea-based creatures.

* Try some of Chicago’s most famous foods. Deep dish pizza, Chicago hot dogs and Italian Beef get the most attention, but we also have other lesser-known specialties such as jibaritos, Tavern-style pizza, Maxwell Street Polish dogs, pizza puffs, Chicago Mix popcorn, Chicken Vesuvio and Rainbow Cones! We also have no shortage of Michelin-starred restaurants and fine dining establishments, as well as cultural hubs for specific cuisines such as Indian on Devon in West Ridge, Vietnamese on Argyle in Uptown, Italian on Taylor in Little Italy, and Mexican on 18th in Pilsen.

* Check out one of our 24 beaches or walk/cycle our 19 mile (30 km) long lakefront park! If you don’t have a bike with you, use our [Divvy bike rental service](https://divvybikes.com/) and explore our many miles of bike paths and trails! Along the lakefront are many beachfront cafes, bars and attractions.

* Catch some live music! We get [lots of touring artists at our many theaters across the city](https://do312.com/events/live-music/today), but we also have some iconic jazz and blues venues with nightly music like [Buddy Guy’s Legends,](https://buddyguy.com/?page_id=275) [The Green Mill](https://greenmilljazz.com/) and [Kingston Mines.](https://www.kingstonmines.com/?v=7516fd43adaa)

* See a show! From [Broadway in Chicago](https://www.broadwayinchicago.com/) to [magic shows,](https://www.chicagomagiclounge.com/) Chicago has it all. We are most famous for comedy, so don’t miss spots such as [Second City](https://www.secondcity.com/chicago), [iO Theatre](https://ioimprov.com/) and the [Annoyance Theatre.](https://www.theannoyance.com/)

* Locals often refer to [Navy Pier](https://navypier.org/) as a tourist trap, but it's worth seeing at least once. It can be a fun spot to spend a couple of hours. Check out the [Children's Museum,](https://navypier.org/location/chicago-childrens-museum/) the Ferris Wheel (did you know the world's first Ferris Wheel was opened in Chicago in 1893?) and the many gift shops throughout the pier.

* Get outside of downtown! The Loop is iconic but the neighborhoods are where the action really happens! Some awesome neighborhoods to check out include Lincoln Park, Logan Square, Wicker Park, Lake View, Andersonville, Lincoln Square, Hyde Park and Pilsen.

* [Cloud Gate (AKA ""The Bean"")](https://www.choosechicago.com/articles/tours-and-attractions/the-bean-chicago/) is Chicago's most famous sculpture, but we have many other public scultpures worth checking out as well! Some well-known ones includes [the untitled ""Chicago Picasso,""](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_s_publicartthepicassountitledsculpture.html) Lorado Taft's [Fountain of Time in Washington Park](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/washington-fountain-time) and [Eternal Silence in Graceland Cemetery,](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/eternal-silence) [Calder's Flamingo,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamingo_(sculpture) [Statue of the Republic in Jackson Park,](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/statue-republic) and [Shit Fountain!](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/shit-fountain)

* Explore Chicago’s architectural heritage! In addition to our boat tours, the [Chicago Architecture Center](https://www.architecture.org/) is an awesome resource with a museum and walking tours. Visit the [Frank Lloyd Wright Museum](https://flwright.org/tour/home-and-studio) in Oak Park and the [Robie House in Hyde Park](https://flwright.org/tour/robie-house)! If you’re visiting in October, check out [Open House Chicago](https://openhousechicago.org/) to see inside of buildings that are usually closed to the public.

* The [Garfield Park Conservatory](https://garfieldconservatory.org/) is a massive botanical conservatory and one of the most underrated attractions in Chicago. Don’t miss the Fern Room!

* Take the Water Taxi to Chinatown and have dinner and drinks in the nation’s fastest-growing Chinatown.

* See a sports game. For Baseball, the Cubs play at the famous Wrigley Field, and the White Sox are at Guaranteed Rate Field on the South Side. The United Center on the West Side hosts both the Bulls (basketball) and the Blackhawks (hockey). And at Soldier Field, you can see the Bears (football) and the Fire (soccer)!

* Do you drink? Chicago is famous for its corner bar culture. Pop into a nearby tavern and order a Chicago Handshake (Old Style beer and a shot of Malört, Chicago’s famous wormwood spirit). You could also check out one of the city’s many craft beer breweries or distilleries. If you want a rooftop bar with a view, some popular options are [Cindy’s Rooftop,](https://www.cindysrooftop.com/) [London House Rooftop,](https://londonhousechicago.com/rooftop/) [The Up Room at the top of the Robey Hotel,](https://www.therobey.com/) and the [J. Parker at the top of the Lincoln Hotel](https://www.jparkerchicago.com/). Be sure to book reservations in advance!

* Go to Hyde Park and explore the campus of the University of Chicago. While there, pay a visit to the [Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures](https://isac.uchicago.edu/). Don’t forget to grab lunch in downtown Hyde Park and take a walk to Promontory Point for a unique skyline photo!

* Also in Hyde Park, Jackson Park was the site of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. Don’t miss the Japanese Garden!

* Take a stroll through a cemetery! This might sound like a strange recommendation, but cemeteries were originally used as public parks and were popular picnic spots in the 1800s and 1900s. Chicago has many large cemeteries but the most popular are Rosehill, Graceland, Oak Woods and Bohemian National.

* Head up to Andersonville and check out the many gift shops, antique stores, restaurants, bars and other attractions along Clark Street.

* During the summer, there are many street festivals, craft fairs and small community music festivals all around the city. Do a Google search for festivals happening during your visit and you might get to experience a fun local event!

It was such an amazing experience, I learned a ton and loved every minute of it. Deffo helped it was 26degrees in April which is unheard of apparently 

- have a drink at the top of Hancock building - incredible views - again I got lucky as it was warm, clear and sunny so could see for miles

- go watch bulls, Blackhawks or cubs games 

- go dive bar hopping - met some incredible people there, who made my stay amazing, so much so I'm going back again in April for 3rd time

- walk around downtown without a map - loved doing this. Found some really quirky shops, bars and buildings 

- Italian beef sandwich - research best spot for one. I never tried Chicago deep dish pizza as it doesn't sound appealing to me at all

- spend a day outside of downtown in areas such as bucktown, Lincoln park etc - the best bars and restaurants are all outside of downtown imo

- put your middle finger up at the trump building",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1iwmrw6,

Money Museum is likely not open on Sunday, and the Surgical Musuem isn’t very big and is kind of pricey relative to the size. The Conservatory is lovely but far. Do you not like art?

I did not have great fashion sense. Mostly it was just overwhelming. 
I met with them once in late winter to do some spring/summer outfits, and then again in late summer to do fall/winter. 
The reason I recommend this is that I had no idea how to dress for my body. The shopper picked stuff I literally never would have even thought of and while I didn’t like all of it, the outfits I did like are seriously awesome. I feel SO GOOD in the clothes. 
I learned how to dress so that I can keep feeling confident, and I learned to be more adventurous with some choices. I also learned how to shop - where to invest in good pieces and where not to waste my money.

Based on what you said about what you like to do, I get the vibe that you might like living off the brown/red line (any of the stops north of the loop) and the northwestern stretch of the blue line (between Montrose and Clark/Lake) the most, plus or minus some of the green/pink line stops in west loop. Logan square is a great place to start as you can explore along the blue line while also going north/south; Humboldt Park would be a good spot as it has a fairly large park and has The 606 which is a former rail line turned trail for cyclists/runners.

I'd take day 1 to explore logan square, Humboldt, Wicker Park, Bucktown. Lots of bars around and great food; Paulie Gee's is great pizza at Wicker Park and there's also a Seoul Taco (Korean/Mexican fusion) which is similarly delicious. You might also have time to explore downtown itself and decide if you'd like to live in the loop proper; I'd recommend checking out the lakefront trail around Grant Park.

Day 2 can be all north side visits. Lots of bike trails on the lakefront going north (and south past museum of science and industry fwiw). Also a ton of bike trails by the north branch of the Chicago river which take you into the northern suburbs and even up to Wisconsin. You can find similar trails south, but I think it's a little harder to get out of the city southbound than north, imo. Montrose Beach is a good spot to check out as it's near Uptown/Lincoln Square/Ravenswood. If you live anywhere by the Argyle red line stop it's all Asian food (used to be primarily Vietnamese but it's turned into a mini Chinatown in the past few years). 

Don't know about anywhere else, but lots of places have resident lots/individual garages for apts, not a whole lot of indoor parking outside of big high rises though. I know for sure that the north side has Astound broadband's fiber network, but not sure if it spreads out to Logan Square.

Generally, if you like biking a lot, I'd live anywhere near the lakefront trail or any of the Chicago river trails. There are lots of Chicago biking events like critical mass, bikesox, etc. Something I enjoy in the fall is Rails, Trails, and Ales where the Metra runs additional heritage corridor trains heading out of the city so you can hop on bike trails like I&M Canal. You won't be far from biking/greenery if you're near the metra. 

Also, Sep 20-22 is when a large music festival happens in Douglass Park, so there's gonna be a lot of folks on the trains, especially in the loop and the pink line. I'm also positive lots of people in the Logan Square and Wicker Park area will be making the trek to Riot Fest as well, so keep that in mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1fd5evf,

I think maybe you should ask if you're lonely, or if you're bored. If it's a loneliness issue, look for ways to meet people doing things. Play rec sports, join a hobby meetup, go to events and make small talk with people that seem cool, whatever feels like the least painful or most rewarding approach.

when I first moved here, I drank more, and I'd often go to restaurants and sit at the bar with a book or watch a game. People doing the same are usually down for conversation, and if you don't over-profile people before you get to know them, you can meet some really cool people. The bartenders and wait staff were always fun to talk to and super interesting. It doesn't fit my lifestyle as much now, but it helped me feel like I was scratching the social itch. 

If you can get over the awkwardness of going to things alone, you really get used to it. It's hard at first for some people, but keep going and you'll figure out how to be alone in a crowd.

Twin Anchors is an old pub with some of the best BBQ ribs ever. Make sure you pick the prohibition sauce (sweet and spicy). This was Sinatra’s favorite place to eat in Chicago where the original booth remains where he used to eat. 

While in Wrigley, add Murphy Bleachers to your list. Catch a Cubs game on TV (they’ll be on the road). 

While at Sluggers, make sure you go up to the second floor to try the batting cages. Talk about fastballs!! They even have dueling pianos on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 

I’d say forget stocks n blondes, and replace it with Streeter’s Tavern (River North). 

I’d skip McGees (big sports bar) and replace it with King of Cups (very cool interior). 

Replay Lincoln Park is always having some kind of retro pop up theme and has old arcades (nostalgic).

Of the two, I prefer Simon's and on quiet weekday afternoons staff might give a tour of the historic elements of the place. 
     After Simon's and maybe Hopleaf you could stretch your legs walking south on Ravenswood to the Koval tasting room/bar (craft whiskeys and liqueurs) and a block or two away is Dovetail Brewing (traditional German style lagers and wild ales). Both are great about answering questions and sharing stories.
     At Koval, my visiting brother and I were offered shots from their last bottle of 5-grain whiskey. Turns out while making their 4-grain whiskey, someone screwed up and added an extra grain to the recipe, producing a single batch of the new version. That's the great thing about sitting at the bar when things aren't too busy, little surprises and great conversations with staff and patrons. 
     Chicago's brewery tap rooms, some quite small and personal, have given me some of my best social experiences in town. There's sincere appreciation of their craft without attitude or competitiveness. Brewers are quick to share their favorite places and it's easy to strike up conversations with other beer loving customers. To try a variety of beers, order less than full pints and dazzle your taste buds.
     My favorite breweries are often near others for convenient variety. Dovetail is a block from Begyle, Half Acre has Spiteful Brewing next door, and Off Color is not far from Goose Island on Clybourn.

You can always check out Wheaton and Geneva on your own “dime” - as they’re on the UP West line out of Ogilvie Station. Metra does weekend passes… so you pay once and go between any zones all weekend. 

With Fermi Lab I bet you all can go whenever since you’re UofC students… those Bison are huge! 

One other idea - this you would have to arrange ahead of time as it’s a private museum - Perfume Passage Museum in Barrington. I have not gone, but I know the design firm that built it.

Everyone has different preferences as far as clubs are concerned, but heres my quick guide:

Spybar is by far my favorite venue, great bookings and vibe. Its smallish (400-500 capacity) but great sound and crowd. They have a few tables, but its not like Prysm, which is mostly focused on getting people to pay +$1500 for their tables.

Smartbar is also one of the best venues in the country. They're a little smaller than Spy, so don't book as many popular artists, but its a great venue overall. Their Sunday Queen shows are geared toward the LGBT crowd, but they're a blast for straight house-heads too.

Prysm is bigger, and books some great acts, but as alluded to above its pretty bougie. Expensive drinks, usually a douchey crowd. Its a lot like Tao, which I just hate. You know, that kind of club.

Well-known artists frequent theaters such as Concord Music Hall, Aragon ballroom, The Vic, and Riviera to name a few. Concord is by far the best. Aragon is a terrible experience overall, but they book some good dubstep artists.

Radius is our massive 5000-person club. Drinks are pricey, but if you want to see the biggest artists in the game its one of the best clubs of its size in the country. I personally prefer the more intimate feel of our smaller clubs, but find myself at Radius every month or two. The Salt Shed is another massive venue that opened recently. Its good, but they rarely have house/EDM shows.

Theres some smaller places like Listening Room (look up House Calls on Instagram), Podlaise, Smoke & Mirrors too that have great shows every week or two. Smoke and Mirrors is one of my favorites.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/16phdor,

Now, I also want to say, if you're hanging out in places with loud music and dance floors sober, maybe you're hanging in the wrong places?

There's so many cool corner locals, high end snugs, craft beer halls, etc. where you could meet friends, have good deep chats watch a sporting event without bros shouting at the top of their lungs, etc. 

Pick any place that caters to people idk, not 21 years old? They will have non-alc options and won't feel weird if youre sober because most people arent getting blitzed.

Chicago isn't great for outdoors stuff. That's just a fact. But there are plenty of nice green spaces in the city and so so so many decent places within short driving distance to make a weekend camping trip. 

Find friends that don't want to drink every weekend. Meetup.com or something similar. I know people who have joined run clubs, chess clubs, reading groups, climbing groups, and made really good friends and spent time not drinking. 

That being said, if your priorities have fully shifted, then maybe Chicago isn't the best place for you now. There's no surf, no ski, none of the extreme stuff. Maybe another city would be better. 

Chicago is a world class bar and restaurant scene, a big enough population to entertain even the most niche interest groups (there's a whole butterfly spotting group out there. Not joking) and has lots to offer just about anyone. Out of my friends that don't like it here tend to want top tier outdoor sports or were hoping to make a career out of the arts and didn't see the avenues that NYC provided. It sounds like you might be the former? Lots of great places in the Southwest for extreme sports.

I know that sounds insane but please hear me out.

In summer you've got crowds, bugs, fire is too hot, food can't be left out, etc etc

But in the winter I usually take some light gear and set up for daytime only (past 6pm is dangerous without proper equipment). This means setting up a fire and not needing to bring water to put it out (only use wood, no oil or anything). I might pack food or bring food to cook. I used to have a tiny pan to roast sweet potato on. Warm food by a fire is great after a winter hike, also lots more peaceful if you hate bugs.   


The point is to get vitamin D from the sun which is in low supply in winter so finding a way to take in all of it is difficult. This does require leaving the city but for a day trip its not that bad just remember to bring a change of clothes in case you get wet.

Meeting a social support network is hard, so the first step is to always be gentle with yourself throughout the process and to try to enjoy your own company.

I've been in Chicago for 3 years now and it wasn't until year 3 that I felt like I found my solid groups of people who I love/care about me. Year 1 was lonely, and year 2 got better but I think the more roots you establish the easier it is. I've met people in all types of settings, and if I feel a connection with someone I try to pursue the lead (get contact info, initiate first plans). If they initiate back I just keep up the cycle, but if they're flaky/not as interested in engaging I let them go (or maybe they can be nice acquaintances). It is also key for me to let go of only searching for people like me, (fellow 20/30 something professionals) and open the possibilities to everyone. This is how I got old people to be my friend, hahaha. It's important not to take the process personally though, the fact that you are trying is what matters!

Here are some successful places I've made my long time friends in Chicago:

-Shitty part time jobs - I worked at a gym my first couple years here to make ends meet while in grad school. It was a crazy toxic work environment but damn does that bond people together! I met one of my best friends in Chicago there, and another close girlfriend too. I've got plenty of peers/casual friends from the gym as well since so many people come in and out. Finding a crappy part time job was surprisingly a great place for me to build community via commiserating lol. Also I utilized the gyms workout classes and met people there!

-I was in group therapy for awhile when I moved here, and once group therapy ended the facilitators said we could connect outside of therapy if we wanted to (just not while we were in it). Funnily enough I met one of my best girlfriends there too, we just clicked in the group and both pursued a friendship once it was done

-Mutual friends is a big one, I went to a Big10 school so had some carryover with college friends to Chicago friends (not THAT many though). However - anytime I'm invited to a group event and I can go, I do go. It's a good place to meet people or even find what types of people you like.


-Random stores - I'm the type of person who repetitively becomes a regular at stores nearby my house/work. (Starbucks, Trader Joes, Pet Supplies Plus, corner stores). I've made some solid social media connections from just being friendly with the workers in the store and seeing them so often. Starbucks has always been a great place to talk with the staff as they're typically v friendly

I also try to ask for peoples instagram if I find we click pretty quickly, gives you an opportunity to engage with them more if things work out :) Good luck!!!! Friends are out there!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/15osgw1,

If the funds allow, I’d consider joining somewhere like the East Bank Club. You start seeing the same people there and maybe over time that’ll lead to friendships. At a minimum, it’s a place to hang out away from the lonely apartment.

I like the idea of a part-time evenings and weekend job as an antidote to loneliness. 

Not sure if this is your cup of tea, but perhaps consider joining some sort of church group targeted towards young adults. They usually have volunteer and social activities throughout the year. If you stick with one group long enough, you should make some decent friends over time. 

Other advice like getting involved in a fitness class are good. 

From *my* perspective, nothing will give you a deeper more lasting friendship than a relationship. So keep trying that, using various different apps. Eventually something should click if you’re doing your part.

I know that I’ve often gotten sad when walking down the street and seeing a group of friends eating at a restaurant and knowing that I don’t have friends that I can do that with.  I’d recommend meeting with a therapist to learn strategies about how to deal with this tough situation and at least get better at tolerating it and not letting it lead to deep depression. I recommend doing all that you can to accept your current situation, to “embrace the suck”. Try your best to look at the positive side of things (easier said than done, I know). Rather than think, “it’s Friday night and I have no one to hang out with,” focus instead on “it’s Friday night and I’m not in prison and I don’t have any family members I have to stay home and care for.

Read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, it will help you look at life through a different lens.

I have been in your shoes before, not with the mental health part but with the new city part. I have lived in NYC, LA, Atlanta and now Chicago.

It is hard to make friends with people but that is because most people are really not worth it, sorry if that sounds a bit harsh but it is the truth.

Most younger people can't hold a conversation, know nothing of life, they live in cyber space.

My strongest piece of advice to you is to . . . get involved with the arts. You will meet a different type of person in these walks of life. In particular, start acting or doing improv or comedy.

Listen no where and I mean no where on planet earth is it harder to make friends with people than LA. It is the loneliest place on fucking earth and you are surrounded by people at all times. I was able to forge long lasting friendships with people I met through acting. My closest bunch of friends were comedians who . . . dabbled in MMA.

Which brings me to my second suggestion, do martial arts, jiu jitsu, boxing or straight MMA. It will help you with all aspects of life, your physical health, mental health, self confidence, everything buddy. I dont wanna sound like a snake oil salesman but fighting is the best thing I have done with my life. I have made two good friends out of it, but most importantly the education I received from it has helped me succeed in life.

first things first, you need to change your perspective slightly and not beat up on yourself so much. loneliness is a huge problem these days for a lot of adults so you are not alone in being alone. it’s not a moral failure on your part. i’d also try not to take things so personally when your invites get turned down. people have busy lives, shit comes up, they also might just be shy, etc. 

secondly, there’s a piece of advice one of my friends gave me years ago that has always stuck with me: “*Go* to where your interests/hobbies *are*” i.e. you mentioned MTG. one my friends was just telling me today he plays magic all the time at Dice Dojo in Edgewater. *Go*. 

*go* to Music Box in Lakeview and watch some art house movie you like, maybe one with a Q&A session if they do that kind of thing. who cares if you’re flying solo? no one’s going to give you a hard time and there’ll probably be others doing it alone too. 

these are a couple examples but my point is to give yourself the grace to *go* to thing you like for the sake of enjoying it for yourself and not necessarily to make a million friends. once you get comfortable doing that, you’ll start bumping into the same people over and over and eventually they’ll want to get to know you. i guarantee it. 

it worked for me - i went and did the things i enjoyed, not necessarily as friendship finding missions but as outings strictly for myself to have fun. i eventually got comfortable talking to the people i saw and now have more friends here than back where i’m from. i was out just about every night last week and struggle to keep up with all the group chats and text conversations i’m in during the work day.

Sulzer library is currently having a once a month, bring your own craft session.   Sometimes library branches have make and takes or leftover kits.  You might be able to request some to be sent to a branch near you.  What crafts are you into?

I also like to just explore and see what murals are around.  Some neighborhoods like Pilsen, Logan Square tends to have a lot, but there are interesting finds in out of the way nooks.

To get some walking in, I like to visit Little Free Libraries.  I find official and unofficial ones and make different routes on Google maps.

A few years ago I bought a book called Tree Finder that helps you identify trees.  You can also try birdwatching or just being more intent on finding and listening to birds.  I have seen a hawk or kestrel by Lane Tech.

There are a few riverwalk areas (nature, not commercial/retail) along the river on the north side. Near Lawrence is a good area.  Also by Lane Tech is an area with a boat house.

Whenever I will be in an area I have not been in before, I look on Google maps to see what is near there.  I don't drive so I like to travel more efficiently.

You can do some volunteering.

Sometimes businesses will have free events.  I think Home Depot for instance has small projects for kids.  Old Town School of Folk Music has free/pay what you can Wednesday concerts.

Now that it's summer there are lots of events at the parks.

If you have a yard, maybe start a small garden, or grow some herbs with your kids.  Build a small project for the yard or parkway, like a birdhouse.

Many suburban libraries have events anyone can attend.

If you can afford the time away from the kids, don't be shy about going further out.  I've been to Skokie, Park Ridge, and Hyde Park all on public transit.  Or you can take the kids if the events are kid friendly.

The library has changed their museum pass system and there are different organizations added and the system is all online now.  Ask them for help if you are interested.

Some universities have events where the public is welcome to attend.  There are many other organizations too, like Dank Haus for German cooking or German movies, City Newsstand at Cicero/Irving Park has live music sometimes.  There is a veteran's museum near there too.

Maybe find a Portuguese restaurant and practice your accent?  Ask if they might know of places to practice and people to practice with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/14kxf96,

Anyway, in the spirit of things to do, I was also looking at doing a Gangster tour (super cheesy, but looks like fun), Paper Machete at the Green Mill on Saturday afternoon.  There’s Batzu! (Comedy show) in Old Town (Second City too!).   May head to Pilsen for some Mexican food/drinks.   

We’re def hitting up Pequods because it isn’t too far from our place. 

A good opportunity for some silly photos - Big yellow door at Big Monster Toys in West Loop, or the Wings of Mexico near Michigan Ave. Both are pretty low grade tourism, but fun to do. 

Of course there’s the Weiner Circle…. Or maybe not. 😄",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/13d7ond,
